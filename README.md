# Classification Analysis on GOT Characters
Machine Learning- I used Classification Analysis concepts to analyze probability of survival of characters from Game Of Throne. After doing data cleaning and engineering, I conducted a classification using different methods such as Logistic Regression- with the stats and scikit models-, KNN classification, Classification Trees, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifier. I thus tuned the parameters and reconducted some of the classification methods to obtain better results (Training and testing accuracy and the AUC score).

Finally, the best results obtained were from the Random Forest method, after hyperparameter tuning of the data, with an AUC of 0.8531, with high true positives and less errors from the confusion matrix. 
Women and children are the ones which are much likely to survive, especially if they are from noble families, and are from areas with less fights.
